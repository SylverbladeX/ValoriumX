# Valorium X ($VQXAI)
**The bio-inspired blockchain with progressive autonomy**  
*The dawn of a new era of digital trust*

> "The focus is not on the architect, but on the architecture."  
> — Sylver Blade

## What this repository is
This repository hosts the **Valorium X Core** — a reference implementation and research track for an L1 protocol powered by **VIC (Valorium Incentivized Consensus)**.

> ⚠️ **Not financial advice.** This repository and related documents are for research, engineering, and community collaboration.

## Core principles (high-level)
- 🧬 **Double Helix Ledger** — bio-inspired data structure concept
- 🧩 **Cryptographic Interlocking Proof (CIP)** — interlocking proof layer *(tamper-resistance target; under active validation)*
- ⚛️ **Quantum-ready** — post-quantum roadmap and threat modeling
- 🤖 **AI-assisted autonomy** — progressive autonomy as a long-term direction
- 🧪 **Simulation-first** — models, test harnesses, and reproducible experiments where feasible

## Current status (Phase 1)
Phase 1 focuses on:
- Architecture design & specification
- Threat modeling and adversarial simulation
- Publishing technical papers and public-facing documentation
- Building an open simulator and contributor pathways

> **Security-critical implementation details** may be disclosed via controlled review (vetted auditors/partners), and distributed as **signed releases**.
